# Homeworkd: Intro to Ethereum Smart Contracts

## Problem 1. Bad Coding Task or Why Loops are "Forbidden"

Write a smart contract to calculate the factorial of a given number. 
Create two different solutions (iterative and recursive)
* Do you observe any problems?
* How to prevent it?
* Compare both solutions

## Problem 2. Random number generation

Write a smart contract that provides a function that generates a random number.
What kind of problems may occur? Why?
